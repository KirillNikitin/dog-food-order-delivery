This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is prototype of sign-up form of dogs food delivery order. With possibility to choose not only monthly delivery, 
but with more frequently options. Form consists of order information (Customer info, info of the pet, address and so on) 
and the bank card info, where we have validation for cards of Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover Card, Dinner Club 
and JCB payment systems. Functionality can be easily extended for another payment systems as well. 
If card number, cvv and expiration (month and year) valid - it is possible to see the design prototype of saving this card for 
further use in the future.

Range of dog's breeds (now it is only 7 as prototype) can be extended to full plus input field "please enter the dog breed if 
it is not available from the list".

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
